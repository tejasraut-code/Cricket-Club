🔗 Cricket Club Website Clone – Personal Project

🚀 I built a responsive and interactive Cricket Club website clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the look and feel of a modern sports club portal, featuring:

 > Smooth transitions and scroll animations

 > Clean, user-friendly layout with interactive UI components

 > Emphasis on responsiveness and visual aesthetics

🛠️ Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, Locomotive Scroll

🎯 This project helped me sharpen my front-end skills and understand animation workflows in web development.
